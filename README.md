# Intuitive project - Bob the bird keeper

## Problem

Bob the bird keeper has a problem that he thinks you can help him with. His birds are constantly harassed by the neighborâ€™s cats who are looking for a quick dinner. To protect his birds, Bob has setup a camera triggered alarm that goes off when a cat is nearby. In order to help Bob, please design and implement an automated algorithm that triggers when a cat is in view of the camera. To reassure him that his birds are alive and well, please also detect if a bird is present in the frame of view.

We have prepared a small dataset to help you out with this problem which contains images of birds and cats with corresponding annotations. The dataset can be downloaded here:
